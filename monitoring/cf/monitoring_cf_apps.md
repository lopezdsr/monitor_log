# Monitoring apps running on Cloud Foundry
 {:#monitoring_bluemix_apps}

When you are using the Cloud Foundry infrastructure to run your apps on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you'll want to keep up with performance information such as health status, resource usage, and traffic metrics. With this performance information, you can then make decisions or take actions accordingly.

To monitor the performance of CF apps, use any of the following methods:

* {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Availability Monitoring to monitor CF apps through the console.
* Third-party options to monitor CF apps through third-party products such as [New Relic ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://newrelic.com/){:new_window}.
