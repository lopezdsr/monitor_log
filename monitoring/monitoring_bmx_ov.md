# Monitoring in Bluemix
{: #monitoring_bmx_ov}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, by default, collects and displays metrics for CPU usage, memory utilization, and network I/O. These metrics provide information about the performance of individual cloud resources. You can monitor the performance of these resources in your cloud environment through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI. You can view near real-time data and historical data.

You can use the monitoring capabilities in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to automatically collect and measure key metrics from your environment and applications. No special instrumentation is required to collect metrics. For example, you can use information provided by performance metrics to monitor how a service is running in the cloud, detect resource bottlenecks, and keep an eye on the service level agreement (SLA). When you analyze performance data for a service, you can detect situations that can lead to a resource bottleneck and consequently affect your service SLA to your clients. By taking early action, you can prevent situations that can impact your business negatively.  

In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you can also use Grafana, an open source analytics and visualization platform, to monitor, search, analyze, and visualize container metrics in a variety of graphs, for example charts and tables. Use Grafana to perform advanced analytical tasks. 

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform monitoring to:

* Gain insight on application operations, for example, detect the potential bottlenecks or when upgrades are required.
* Define trends that you can use to plan future app requirements in your cloud platform.
