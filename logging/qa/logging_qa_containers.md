* [What can I do if I cannot see JSON logs generated by my container in Kibana](logging_qa.html#logging_qa_no_JSON_data_kibana)


## What can I do if I cannot see JSON logs generated by my container in Kibana
{: #logging_qa_no_JSON_data_kibana}

When JSON logs are sent to the Docker logs as stdout, they are not parsed as JSON, and therefore, cannot be sorted by the @timestamp field to change their order. 

The @timestamp values that display are the timestamps from when the logs were received by ElasticSearch. 

The timestamps that reflect when the logs were generated in the container are displayed as part of the message field.

To separate the message field into multiple fields, log JSON to a file rather than stdout. Then, sort the logs in Kibana.
