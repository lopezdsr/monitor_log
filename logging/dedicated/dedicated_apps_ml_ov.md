# Monitoring and logging for Cloud Foundry apps in Dedicated and Local
{: #dedicated_apps_ml_ov}


In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm:}}, Cloud Foundry apps come with built-in logging. You can review the data that is collected from your apps on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

Cloud Foundry apps use Cloud Foundry loggregator to monitor and forward logs from outside of the app. You don't need to install agents inside of the app.

To view your app logs, follow these steps.
1. Select a running app.
2. Click **Logs**. In the **Logs** view, you can view logs from your running app..
4. Click the **Advanced View** button. **Advanced View** shows a more detailed view of the logs by using Kibana, a visualization tool that uses logs and time-stamped data to create custom visualizations. For more information about using the advanced view, see the [Kibana User Guide ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.1/index.html){: new_window}.

Next, you can customize a Kibana dashboard. See [Advanced log analysis with Kibana](../kibana4/analyzing_logs_Kibana.html#analyzing_logs_Kibana) for more information.
